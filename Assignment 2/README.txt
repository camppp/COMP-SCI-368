Problem 1: Beautiful Grades! 

We're going to write a program that reads a file with student information and homework scores. You will manipulate that data to compute the total score and percent for each student and then write a summary file with the computed scores for each student.  Along the way we're going to fix some style issues with the names.

Fill in your name and the additional requested information at the top of the file. Below that notice that required include directives have already been added for you. Two constant variables indicating the maximum possible number of students and the maximum possible number of assignments have been defined at global scope and so are available everywhere. Function prototypes for the four functions you will be writing definitions for appear next.  Do not change these prototypes; you will be adding your code below to finish their definitions. The function main should work as is to call these functions to create the formatted grade summary from the input file. You are strongly encouraged to add additional console output to the main function to verify that your functions are doing what you would like them to do. While we will not be using this main function to evaluate the correctness of your code we will evaluate proper use of C++ style and commenting. We will be using a custom script to test each of your functions individually for correctness. So a mistake in one function will not affect your score for other the functions.

Note main declares several variables that are passed both as call by reference and call by value. Do not change these variables in the main function.
